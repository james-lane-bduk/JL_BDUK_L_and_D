#---Step 1) Initial vouchers Data Extraction and Transformation

#We also need the amount of voucher funding available across all voucher projects, by month, but we want to know what it was like 'at the time'
#To do this, we can iteratively filter for project dates
#This is still a simplification, because we're including all projects regardless of their present day status
#E.g. a project might have been live in Jan 2024, but then cancelled in Mar 2024. So realistically, we wouldn't want to include it...
#...in our 'total voucher funding' available from Mar 2024 onwards, but we will here for simplicity - requires previous snapshots otherwise

#And we want to start 5 months earlier, as e.g. projects published in Jan will typically pay out 5 months later

end_date <- tail(vouchers_paid_by_month$voucher_connected_month, 1) - months(5)

#Check autocorrelation to ensure independence of differenced values (should be minimal AC)
acf(vouchers_paid_by_month_with_lag$diff)


#---End of Step 2)





#---Step 3) Prepare data for vouchers forecast

#Prepare for applying forecasting model - turn data to time-series object

#Get info on fitted model
summary(arima_model)


#Look at the residuals
residuals <- residuals(arima_model)

# Extract fitted values
fitted_values <- fitted(arima_model)



#------------------

#Forecast next 12 months, assuming % of funding remaining declines at a consistent rate
funding_remaining_pct_pt_change <- diff(vouchers_paid_by_month$funding_remaining_pct) %>%
  mean()

#Next 12 values of 'estimated funding remaining'
estimated_funding_remaining_pct <- seq(last(vouchers_paid_by_month$funding_remaining_pct), by = funding_remaining_pct_pt_change, length.out=12)

#And use to forecast connected vouchers over the next 12 months
forecasted_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12, xreg = estimated_funding_remaining_pct)


#Plot forecast
plot(forecasted_values)


#Doesn't quite work - need a way to model drop-off effectively.
